 "'to pick up some equipment I knew the', 'bomb suit would be difficult "

 '"she\'s reaching around she doesn\'t even", "know where that pole she\'s '

 '\'and b to calm yourself my legs are\', "shaking and all I\'m doing is '

 "10 minutes', 'effectively she has about 25 to 30', 'minutes worth of the air "
 'again I cannot\', "see what I\'m doing so basically I will", \'make a '

 'am\', \'so excited to get out of\', "here I\'m ready for Tov", "check '
 'that\'s yes pass all right let\'s go", \'oh my gosh\', "been there for about '
 '14 minutes that\'s", "an excellent time yay so now that you\'ve", \'passed '
 'both of the physical assessments\', "you\'ve got the experience of how the", '
 '"bomb suit feels now we\'re going to give", \'you some practical experience '
 "on how to', 'diffuse and recognize devices and render', 'them safe the', "
 '\'blue the biggest misconception about\', "what bomb squads do it\'s what we '
 'see in", "the media all the time it\'s go down put", \'your face next to '
 'something and cut the\', "red wire we\'re almost never going to go", \'down '
 "and actually put our physical hands', 'on device and clip whatever you', "
 "'want now who can tell me what he did', 'wrong he made up a song about "
 "cutting', 'wir he made up a song about cutting', 'wires unless there is a "
 'human life that\', "I can\'t move away from that suspicious", "device I\'m '
 'never going to go touch it", "with my hands until I know it\'s safe to", "do '
 'so so that\'s where the cutting the", "wire thing comes from that\'s where '
 'the", \'cutting the wire thing comes from and\', "that\'s when I realized '
 'that my idea of", "what bombs look like and how they\'re", \'disabled is '
 "almost entirely based in', 'fiction bombs that we encounter they', "
 '"don\'t look like lot of the stuff we see", "in the media right they\'re not '
 'the", \'sticks of dynamite with a timer on top\', \'and a red wire going to '
 "a Detonator they', 'look like a box a backpack they look', 'like everyday "
 "items IEDs or improvised', 'explosive devices are composed of a', 'variety "
 "of components often everyday', 'items that work together to cause damage', "
 '"or injury when detonated and it\'s the", \'job of a bomb Tech to separate '
 "those', 'components so that the IED can no longer', 'go off and they do this "
 "by using a', 'device called a pan disrupt', 'a percussion actuated non- "
 'electric you\', "don\'t need to remember that what our", \'idea is with '
 "disruption is to hopefully', 'make it so that these components are no', "
 '"longer touching so they can\'t function", \'together anymore this is a 12 '
 "gauge', 'shotgun barrel oh we actually going to', 'shoot something out of "
 'here yes what\', "we\'ll do is we\'ll put a blank in and", "then we\'ll fill '
 'the barrel with water W", \'you had this package earlier yeah and we\', '
 '\'were aiming the laser yep you aimed the\', "laser that\'s going to shoot '
 'that water", \'into that package and as it comes out\', "the water is going '
 'to expand it\'s going", "to rip that package apart and it\'s going", \'to '
 'hopefully accomplish our task so\', "we\'re literally shooting a water", '
 "'projectile at a bomb for the most part', 'yeah but the only way to "
 "determine if a', 'suspicious package is an iev is by', 'confirming that it "
 "has all the', 'components necessary to detonate and to', 'figure that out "
 'safely the first task in\', \'any bomb threat call is to take an\', "x-ray '
 'and then that\'s your X-ray panel", \'right there cool so that gets x-ray\', '
 "'imprinted on it so this gets placed', 'behind the package we shoot the "
 "x-rays', 'through the package and onto the', 'film and then you go and pick "
 "up your', 'X-ray panel without touching without', 'touching the package "
 'there you go so now\', "we\'ll go into the truck and we\'ll", \'develop '
 'these y the red lights this is\', \'our scan developer\', "wow like this yep '
 'and it\'ll start", \'sucking it through so you can see it\', \'scanning in '
 "here now we have one', 'complete image what kind of things do', 'you "
 'immediately see that looks like a\', "like a a battery battery that\'s '
 'exactly", \'what it is does this look like anything\', \'you recogn from '
 "earlier think about the', 'box that was up at the top of the stairs', 'ooh "
 'like one of the lights sticking out\', "on the outside that\'s an LED all '
 'right", \'what else do you see that you recognize\', \'that looks like a '
 "rule of measuring tape', 'close look at it a little bit', 'differently look "
 'is it a kitchen timer\', "it\'s a kitchen timer y good job all", \'right '
 "what about this guy does this look', 'familiar to you at all no have you "
 "ever', 'taken the cover plate off of an', 'electrical outlet or electrical "
 'switch\', \'at home oh is that what it is on the\', "inside mhm this is the '
 'switch that\'s a", \'toggle switch on a l so this is just an\', \'example of '
 "things we could see in an', 'x-ray in the final challenge Yep this', "
 '"itself is not a device we don\'t have the", "explosive materials yeah it\'s '
 'not a bomb", "there\'s no no bomb but if an x-ray does", \'show that the '
 "device is an IED the next', 'step is to safely move it away from any', "
 "'property or civilians and the safest way', 'to do that is through the use "
 "of robots', 'good morning Rob porath rap County bomb', 'squad well first of "
 "all I know we just', 'met but I have a question go ahead do', 'you go by Bob "
 'because it starts with a b\', "and everyone\'s name on the bomb squad", '
 '"starts right my name\'s Robert but a lot", \'of the guys do call me\', '
 '"Bobby let\'s talk robots yes so today I\'m", \'going to drive this you are '
 "going to', 'drive this robots allow us to do some', 'analysis on a "
 'suspicious item without\', \'ever having to send a human down there\', "if I '
 'blow up a robot yeah they\'re", "expensive but they\'re not a human all", '
 '"right let\'s start with just some basic", \'driving this stick right here '
 'push\', \'forward on it and see what the robot\', "does see it\'s starting '
 'to move yeah push", \'to the left bring it towards us that\', \'gets it to '
 "turn all with that simple', 'stick right there right okay cameras are', "
 '\'located here push that one that is your\', "gripper camera so now let\'s '
 'talk about", \'maybe some arm functions press that\', \'button down there '
 "that is moving the arm', 'and the shoulder at the same time and', 'you can "
 'even move just the wrist and you\', "can also go up and down W let\'s try '
 'to", \'pick up that water bottle down there\', "you\'re on the right track '
 'oh oh feel", \'like you have a good grip I think so\', \'beautiful yay now I '
 'can bring a water\', \'bottle to Garrett are you thirsty\', "Garrett wait '
 'don\'t take it let me offer", \'it to\', "you so what\'s next we want you to '
 'run an", \'obstacle course that we have set up but\', "you\'re going to do '
 'it", \'blind and by blind I mean your eyes are\', \'the robots actually '
 "okay', 'okay so we have the robot positioned at', 'start what are the rules "
 'and objectives\', \'for this obstacle course first off\', "you\'re not '
 'allowed to hit any of the", "cones there\'s a bridge that you\'re going", '
 '"to go over it\'s a wooden bridge don\'t", \'fall off of that once you make '
 "it to the', 'end of the course you need to find your', 'suspicious item your "
 'mission is to use\', \'the robot to pick up that pipe bomb and\', "you\'re '
 'going to place it into a", "fragmentation bag oh and there\'s one", \'other '
 "rule okay do not break my', 'robot okay 3 2 1 go oh this perspective', "
 '"is so difficult to use okay I\'m", "approaching the bridge don\'t fall '
 'off", \'that bridge how expensive is this robot\', \'$75,000 for this one '
 "well as you guys', 'know these videos are expensive to make', 'so I want to "

 "'always available and so sometimes bomb', 'techs will instead have to use a "

 'go look over here", \'okay if we wanted wanted to take this\', \'box to '
 "where we were just standing uhhuh', 'and if you were to just hook this "

flattened this week on challenge accepted I am going to bomb squad Academy sh are you ready no Brian I am not ready we'll be detonating real explosives my God and learning how to disable those explosives to render them safe cut the red wire cut the blue wire thing that's kind of a meth so we're literally shooting a projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah all while wearing a 65 lb bomb suit my legs are shaking right now just standing and this All Leads up to my final challenge where I will have to disable a bomb completely by myself before time runs out you're completely alone wearing a 65lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation which could be very dangerous or deadly oh my God challenge accepted [Music] hi it's good morning hi Brian Brian I'm Brad Brian and Brad Brian and Brad on the bomb squad I love all the alliteration did you guys plan that we didn't but there's actually a lot of Brian on the bomb squad are there any Michelle's there's not not yet not yet so what you're going to do right now is our physical assessment that we put all of our new recruits through in order to pass I will have to run a quarter mile while completing a series of difficult tasks tasks that will test my endurance dexterity and memory all in under 17 minutes we actually affectionately refer to the helmet you're going to be wearing as the dumb bucket cuz the dumb bucket when you put that on a lot of the stuff that you've got in your head just kind of goes out the window so you got to concentrate to remember things so we're going to test your memory and if I don't pass the test I won't be allowed to continue the rest of the academy because my body cannot safely endure the mental and physical strain imposed by the 65 lb bomb suit so this is the bomb suit okay this is the first thing you're going to put on are the pants okay the point of the Physical Agility Test is to intentionally stress the candidate your brain has to be able to work while you're physically exhausted and then just put on your head there we go you like a quite contained I feels like I have a bowling ball in my head am I yelling right now a little bit but that's okay oh my God this is going to feel a little bit like it's choking out for a second because that's going to be her first time putting the suit on first time feeling of that 65 lbs of weight on her shoulders all right you're in it how's it feel how does it feel I feel like a drunk Michelin man God Melle are you ready for the assessment I suppose we'll find out very soon Mich there is one more thing that I didn't tell you to start this whole thing you're going to be on your back on the ground yep so that exercise is used to simulate something blew up and you fell on your back and you have to get up so that's that's how you're going to start this whole thing okay probably bad time to say I have to pee I'm guessing Okay right chin up there you go oh my God oh my God Michelle are you ready all right Brian I am not ready so when you are ready your time starts when you physically move and your number is one [Music] this feels so awkward so heavy this part here is just simulating the Long Walk you've left your team at the truck and you are walking towards your objective on a real call you'd be all alone you'd be you and your equipment so the Long Walk is possibly either the scariest or the best part of being a bomb Tech you walk alone probably at least 300 ft down to where the assist best this item is thinking about what am I going to find what do I need to do to keep myself safe what do I need to do to keep the public safe there's so much weight on my lungs like there is just breathing is difficult each obstacle is designed to test a different aspect of being a bomb Tech and is inspired by real life situations a bomb Tech would encounter out on the job and once you touch that silver pole you're done good drop the r oh I'm sweating so next Michelle's going to pick up some equipment I knew the bomb suit would be difficult because of the weight but what I didn't really account for is how much the suit limits your visibility you probably can't see much past the top of that chest plate can you correct she right you can see she's reaching around she doesn't even know where that pole she's reaching for is she can't see it while holding this heavy and awkward equipment I have to take another full lap around the track before starting my next task we're at 5 minutes and 40 seconds right now almost there 10 more yards and after being completely exhausted from the lap I still had to remember the number I was given at the beginning of the challenge and point the laser at it that's it you're good to go you're at 7 minutes right now one more lap this might be a bad idea but I am going to try and run you're going to try and run all right braver than I that's impressive Michelle that's impressive you're doing great this is like deadlifting and running a tent on the trip at the same time having been warned of the difficulty of this test beforehand I actually spent the week's prior strength training and preparation and if you're curious what my strength conditioning looked like for this challenge I uploaded my exact program to my fitness app challenge Fitness which you can find down in the description the next activity she's going to do we have what we call a monkey board basically it's a piece of plywood with a bunch of different activities on it there you go oh my God she's going to have to demonstrate her ability to use basic tools to do things like open a lock not my first time doing locks undo a bolt remove screws God I feel like a baby trying to do this it is it's amazing how much that suit will all of a sudden make simple tasks that much more difficult okay last one the wires strip the insulation off both sides twist it together around that eyeball one two three nice you're done and then the last thing we're going to have her do we're going to have her climb some stairs so we're going to get that heart rate way up and then there's going to be a suspicious device sitting there and she's going to have 20 seconds that's it to look all the way around that device and memorize as many things she can about that green red lift for you red tape time and then she's going to come out to me at the truck and have to tell me everything she can remember about that device time woohoo 1543 was your time all right how you feeling awful let's get this jacket off get you some air all right so your last task tell me what you remember about that box okay the top has a green light thing and then underneath a red light thing and it said a lift for you with red tape and then underneath there was a red bar cool good job you passed so I passed passed yes that was so challenging so what's next so next one we're going to test your fear huh within minutes of finishing the agility test I now have to put the bomb suit back on but this time in addition to a hazmat suit to simulate dealing with a chemical threat really what this test is designed to do is test her ability to work around her fear we're going to put her in a hazmat suit and then we're going to put the bomb suit over the top of that we're going to strap an SCBA bottle to her back and put a gas mask on her face as she has to breathe through stand up my legs are shaking right now just standing it is aot way with all this stuff that we're put on her we're almost going to double her body weight I can do this oh my God you can do it I can do it then if that's not enough we're going to putp her inside of a dark shipping container and seal her [Music] in then I'm going to give her an incredibly simple children's [Music] puzzle okay here we go children's puzzle and it is going to take her a ridiculously long amount of time to complete a children's puzzle oh no that's a trick there's trick sides this one goes here here's the next move okay I think I got two woo that's the ear got this cat this is so uncomfortable I feel so claustrophobic and it just feels like it's getting heavier and heavier by the second it's hard to see obviously she's wearing the uh gas mask plus the advisor helmet for the EOD 10 the SCBA it's not natural air it's hard to breathe so that's something that you have to constantly think about a to conserve air and b to calm yourself my legs are shaking and all I'm doing is standing yes oh yeah right now she's been in there for approximately 10 minutes effectively she has about 25 to 30 minutes worth of the air again I cannot see what I'm doing so basically I will make a decision on so what to do and then I like look away and pray that my hand does what I just thought bam yes oh my gosh one last piece I am so excited to get out of here I'm ready for Tov check that's yes pass all right let's go oh my gosh been there for about 14 minutes that's an excellent time yay so now that you've passed both of the physical assessments you've got the experience of how the bomb suit feels now we're going to give you some practical experience on how to diffuse and recognize devices and render them safe the blue the biggest misconception about what bomb squads do it's what we see in the media all the time it's go down put your face next to something and cut the red wire we're almost never going to go down and actually put our physical hands on device and clip whatever you want now who can tell me what he did wrong he made up a song about cutting wir he made up a song about cutting wires unless there is a human life that I can't move away from that suspicious device I'm never going to go touch it with my hands until I know it's safe to do so so that's where the cutting the wire thing comes from that's where the cutting the wire thing comes from and that's when I realized that my idea of what bombs look like and how they're disabled is almost entirely based in fiction bombs that we encounter they don't look like lot of the stuff we see in the media right they're not the sticks of dynamite with a timer on top and a red wire going to a Detonator they look like a box a backpack they look like everyday items IEDs or improvised explosive devices are composed of a variety of components often everyday items that work together to cause damage or injury when detonated and it's the job of a bomb Tech to separate those components so that the IED can no longer go off and they do this by using a device called a pan disrupt a percussion actuated non- electric you don't need to remember that what our idea is with disruption is to hopefully make it so that these components are no longer touching so they can't function together anymore this is a 12 gauge shotgun barrel oh we actually going to shoot something out of here yes what we'll do is we'll put a blank in and then we'll fill the barrel with water W you had this package earlier yeah and we were aiming the laser yep you aimed the laser that's going to shoot that water into that package and as it comes out the water is going to expand it's going to rip that package apart and it's going to hopefully accomplish our task so we're literally shooting a water projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah but the only way to determine if a suspicious package is an iev is by confirming that it has all the components necessary to detonate and to figure that out safely the first task in any bomb threat call is to take an x-ray and then that's your X-ray panel right there cool so that gets x-ray imprinted on it so this gets placed behind the package we shoot the x-rays through the package and onto the film and then you go and pick up your X-ray panel without touching without touching the package there you go so now we'll go into the truck and we'll develop these y the red lights this is our scan developer wow like this yep and it'll start sucking it through so you can see it scanning in here now we have one complete image what kind of things do you immediately see that looks like a like a a battery battery that's exactly what it is does this look like anything you recogn from earlier think about the box that was up at the top of the stairs ooh like one of the lights sticking out on the outside that's an LED all right what else do you see that you recognize that looks like a rule of measuring tape close look at it a little bit differently look is it a kitchen timer it's a kitchen timer y good job all right what about this guy does this look familiar to you at all no have you ever taken the cover plate off of an electrical outlet or electrical switch at home oh is that what it is on the inside mhm this is the switch that's a toggle switch on a l so this is just an example of things we could see in an x-ray in the final challenge Yep this itself is not a device we don't have the explosive materials yeah it's not a bomb there's no no bomb but if an x-ray does show that the device is an IED the next step is to safely move it away from any property or civilians and the safest way to do that is through the use of robots good morning Rob porath rap County bomb squad well first of all I know we just met but I have a question go ahead do you go by Bob because it starts with a b and everyone's name on the bomb squad starts right my name's Robert but a lot of the guys do call me Bobby let's talk robots yes so today I'm going to drive this you are going to drive this robots allow us to do some analysis on a suspicious item without ever having to send a human down there if I blow up a robot yeah they're expensive but they're not a human all right let's start with just some basic driving this stick right here push forward on it and see what the robot does see it's starting to move yeah push to the left bring it towards us that gets it to turn all with that simple stick right there right okay cameras are located here push that one that is your gripper camera so now let's talk about maybe some arm functions press that button down there that is moving the arm and the shoulder at the same time and you can even move just the wrist and you can also go up and down W let's try to pick up that water bottle down there you're on the right track oh oh feel like you have a good grip I think so beautiful yay now I can bring a water bottle to Garrett are you thirsty Garrett wait don't take it let me offer it to you so what's next we want you to run an obstacle course that we have set up but you're going to do it blind and by blind I mean your eyes are the robots actually okay okay so we have the robot positioned at start what are the rules and objectives for this obstacle course first off you're not allowed to hit any of the cones there's a bridge that you're going to go over it's a wooden bridge don't fall off of that once you make it to the end of the course you need to find your suspicious item your mission is to use the robot to pick up that pipe bomb and you're going to place it into a fragmentation bag oh and there's one other rule okay do not break my robot okay 3 2 1 go oh this perspective is so difficult to use okay I'm approaching the bridge don't fall off that bridge how expensive is this robot $75,000 for this one well as you guys know these videos are expensive to make so I want to say a huge thank you to Sofi who is sponsoring this video and literally helping me give away $10,000 to one of you watching Bob do you Sofi I don't well let me tell you why you should in case you didn't know Sofi is the all-in-one finance app that lets you Bank borrow and invest with Sofi checking and savings you can earn up to 4.60% % apy with direct deposit which is 10 times the national average savings rate isn't that crazy that is yeah and in just 5 weeks the money sitting in your savings account can earn more money than it would in an entire year at a big Bank savings account who are you currently banking with we'll bleep it oh oh oh there's the bomb okay I'm going for it here we go I mean did you know that Sofi lety get paid up to two days early pay no account fees and cash in on up to $300 when you sign up with direct deposit go on tell me more oh I missed it my depth perception is off well the best news is Sofi has helped me give away $10,000 to one of you guys watching to pursue whatever your dream ambition is grabbing the Bott not and going back to enter sign up for a Sofi checking in savings account right now using my link you can click the link in the description or scan the QR code on screen to enter for your chance to win just make sure to use my link cuz it's the only way to enter for a chance to win oh no oh God so I want to say a huge thank you to SOI for sponsoring this of the video and literally making this whole thing possible oh I missed so that was bad that was bad I was right at the Finish Line potentially an explosion where you don't want it to happen Okay however robots are not always available and so sometimes bomb techs will instead have to use a much more dangerous option a technique known as rigging so let's go look over here okay if we wanted wanted to take this box to where we were just standing uhhuh and if you were to just hook this line right up to this what's going to happen as soon as you start pulling it's going to hit these going to hit these it's going to get stuck right so we have some tools in our rigging kit that allow us to change direction this pulley right here is designed to open up and break away so we can put this ball on the Rope here so now if we run this rope through this pulley as you're pulling along as that ball goes through that pulley opens H then just clip on that Carabiner attach to the handle there and then let's go back to where we started and you can pull it there you go oh that would be really bad what do we do in this situation so we would come back down and fix it and why is this better than me just picking it up so in a situation like what just happened moving this is still potential to anger it so you picking it up you might still could set it off so it changed Direction and now it's coming right back to you these techniques are crucial to do with Precision because even a slight miscalculation could be devastating and so Engineers are constantly improving the technology of bomb suits to keep the technician inside safe we have in the museum at our Sheriff's Office an old old bomb suit it looks like a combination between the Iron Man suit and a night and shining armor suit it's literally got slits in the eyes but even with modern bomb suits a bomb Tech's feet and hands are actually still exposed she's going to realize that we don't have gloves on when we're in the suit we don't have a lot of protection on our feet so if something goes wrong even if I survive I might come out of it without hands I might come out of it without feet I might come out of it with severe injuries that's one of the realities I have to accept and that's a reality that my family had to accept also one of the activities we're going to do with Michelle this week is we're going to take her out to our explosive range we're going to demonstrate to her the effects of explosives and although this is a controlled demonstration set up by professionals we have to treat the tests as a serious danger because when it comes to explosives Anything Can Happen coming down so we're going to start small we're going to show very small explosives very small energetic items first I need to show you is this the button these are the buttons the button the buttons so you're going to hold down charge until the green light lights up and then you're going to push fire I got very scared when you push that just like so what I need from you first left downrange and right okay fire in the hole loud fire in the hole fire in the hole fire in the hole all right now hold down charge until you get a green light and then press fire at the same time yep good wao oh it actually looks really cool it makes so much smoke happy 4th of [Music] July oh my God Jesus Christ fire in the hole it sounds so we s that was a good one right I didn't have my glasses on Oh no you're okay behind the trucks then we're going to work our way up to some pretty big charges when I say big charges it's not a large amount of material but it's very powerful material we're going to use the actual explosive that was used in the Oklahoma City bombing a massive Car Bomb exploded outside of a large Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City shattering that building killing 168 people including 19 children it was a huge explosion and that the explosive used was most likely a simple combination of fertilizer and fuel oil the explosive is using the Oklahoma City bombing so we've got some of that that's what's in this big bag down here wow it was well publicized in those days that it was basically fertilizer that's what this is this will look very much like the fertilizer you put in your lawn the white pills but it's also an explosive when it's mixed with a fuel and we're going to show how an incredibly small amount to that explosive what damage it does so you can basically translate that into someone who has thousands of pounds of that doing bad things we're armed oh my God this is crazy you guys ready here we go fire in the [Music] hole woo coming down whoa it's all right so for reference I mean this is how this is how deep we are wow so this is about 12 lb of ammonium nitrate what they use in Oklahoma city was significantly more than that it was basically you know a rental truck full so if this is what just 12 lbs and a couple little bags will do thank goodness that uh those things don't happen every day now I know what I am up against and why it's so important to to render safe quickly it's unfortunate we have a need for a bomb squad but unfortunately history through the existence of mankind has proved us that humans are going to do bad things ER at the Boston Marathon twin explosion shatter a celebration turning a day of joy into a deadly nightmare but the real Horror Story here was in the garage level of the World Trade Center that's where the explosion was and they found people dead trapped in their cars so we have to have units like the bomb squad to go out and deal with these things explosive devices they can Target police officers they can Target civilians they can Target all kinds of different entities and my initial goal being a police officer is you know help protect the community help solve problems oh my God no the window blew out on our production B from that explosion so for my final challenge obviously I won't be dealing dealing with a real explosive device however when I imagine having to do that with these ramifications in real life it's absolutely terrifying Michelle's final challenge this week we're going to present her with as close as possible a real bomb response a local fire department recently fired an employee this employee has made several threats when the chief walked out to his vehicle he found like a toolbox underneath his car there is the package right underneath the driver's side Tire okay will I have comms in the suit something we haven't covered yet interestingly why you're not going to have comms someone could theoretically build a device that's sensitive to radio frequencies so if you were to have comms down there you could potentially set something off we don't want to do that my mission is to enter the parking garage locate the suspicious item and then determine if it's an active IED if it is it'll be my responsibility to use the tools at my disposal to render it safe all right if you're ready it's time to get you suit it up I'm ready let's do it when I'm walking down the long walk I'm alone wearing a 65- lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation which could be very dangerous or deadly if something goes wrong I could be severely injured I could lose my life and that's a reality I have to accept [Music] every step feels like molasses oh my God [Music] body is so warm my hands are freezing cold where is it okay here's the car there's a silver forward put the panel down [Music] first okay put the X-ray down I can't see okay I think this is in the right position I have 60 seconds before I have to get up though so that I'm far enough away from the X-ray I hope I did that right I really hope I did okay let's see what's in the box you go pull it all the way through I'm still catching my breath it's tiring it's just all the residual fatigue is just catching up to me we've got an image did it work it worked yay all right what do you see immediately tell me what you see I see a battery right there right and it looks like it is connect connected to a switch okay do you remember what kind of switch that is micro switch it's a micro switch where are these wires going into something dark and mysterious in the back is that C4 it looks to be potentially some sort of plastic explosive right is this device safe to move I mean the switch there it makes me nervous but you diagnosed that switch correctly what has to happen for that switch it has to be unlocked yep the lid has to be open so what's the only thing that you should not do to this open it open the lid right now that that we have confirmed that the device is an active IED I now need to use rigging to safely move the device away from the truck to avoid the destruction of property and though this device is not a real explosive it is rigged with sensors and alarms that will go off to signify that it has been detonated resulting in an instant [Music] failure here here I should carry it okay yes yes yes yes okay put it in here [Music] [Music] okay do [Music] this this [Applause] no no no no no no yes yes yes yes yes hell yeah welcome back how you feeling look exhausted [Music] all right how long was that like 3 hours later it's about an hour that was a long one you got the package where we wanted it hope so you got the disruptor set up yeah all right it's time to push the button this button is going to feel so satisfying to push after all that I just hope it works I do too all right we need some fires in the hole from you fire in the hole fire and all fire and all fire buttons right there please work oh I really hope that worked me too holy smokes holy cow the battery there's the battery it's the initiator and the explosive okay it need me 25 ft apart here we [Music] go mission accomplished yes you kicked butt for all your hard work your dedication we want to present you with this plaque honorary member honorary member of the rapal county Squad thank you so much for bringing attention to what we do I really really hope that everyone watching can see what a privilege it is to have a bomb squad in our communities especially one like this where you guys are just incredible it's our pleasure thanks again thank you you know after this whole week I finally realized how to accurately describe what it feels like to be in the suit do tell feels like being boo in Monsters Z when she's dis ized as a monster except that costume weighs 65 lb let's get you out of this boo yay
segments: ['this week on challenge accepted I am going to bomb squad Academy sh are you ready no Brian I am not ready well be detonating real explosives my God and learning how to disable those explosives to render them safe cut the red wire cut the blue wire thing thats kind of a meth so were literally shooting a projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah all while wearing a 65 lb bomb suit my legs are shaking right now just standing and this All Leads up to my final challenge where I will have to disable a bomb completely by myself before time runs out youre completely alone wearing a 65lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation which could be very dangerous or deadly oh my God challenge accepted ', ' hi its good morning hi Brian Brian Im Brad Brian and Brad Brian and Brad on the bomb squad I love all the alliteration did you guys plan that we didnt but theres actually a lot of Brian on the bomb squad are there any Michelles theres not not yet not yet so what youre going to do right now is our physical assessment that we put all of our new recruits through in order to pass I will have to run a quarter mile while completing a series of difficult tasks tasks that will test my endurance dexterity and memory all in under 17 minutes we actually affectionately refer to the helmet youre going to be wearing as the dumb bucket cuz the dumb bucket when you put that on a lot of the stuff that youve got in your head just kind of goes out the window so you got to concentrate to remember things so were going to test your memory and if I dont pass the test I wont be allowed to continue the rest of the academy because my body cannot safely endure the mental and physical strain imposed by the 65 lb bomb suit so this is the bomb suit okay this is the first thing youre going to put on are the pants okay the point of the Physical Agility Test is to intentionally stress the candidate your brain has to be able to work while youre physically exhausted and then just put on your head there we go you like a quite contained I feels like I have a bowling ball in my head am I yelling right now a little bit but thats okay oh my God this is going to feel a little bit like its choking out for a second because thats going to be her first time putting the suit on first time feeling of that 65 lbs of weight on her shoulders all right youre in it hows it feel how does it feel I feel like a drunk Michelin man God Melle are you ready for the assessment I suppose well find out very soon Mich there is one more thing that I didnt tell you to start this whole thing youre going to be on your back on the ground yep so that exercise is used to simulate something blew up and you fell on your back and you have to get up so thats thats how youre going to start this whole thing okay probably bad time to say I have to pee Im guessing Okay right chin up there you go oh my God oh my God Michelle are you ready all right Brian I am not ready so when you are ready your time starts when you physically move and your number is one ', ' this feels so awkward so heavy this part here is just simulating the Long Walk youve left your team at the truck and you are walking towards your objective on a real call youd be all alone youd be you and your equipment so the Long Walk is possibly either the scariest or the best part of being a bomb Tech you walk alone probably at least 300 ft down to where the assist best this item is thinking about what am I going to find what do I need to do to keep myself safe what do I need to do to keep the public safe theres so much weight on my lungs like there is just breathing is difficult each obstacle is designed to test a different aspect of being a bomb Tech and is inspired by real life situations a bomb Tech would encounter out on the job and once you touch that silver pole youre done good drop the r oh Im sweating so next Michelles going to pick up some equipment I knew the bomb suit would be difficult because of the weight but what I didnt really account for is how much the suit limits your visibility you probably cant see much past the top of that chest plate can you correct she right you can see shes reaching around she doesnt even know where that pole shes reaching for is she cant see it while holding this heavy and awkward equipment I have to take another full lap around the track before starting my next task were at 5 minutes and 40 seconds right now almost there 10 more yards and after being completely exhausted from the lap I still had to remember the number I was given at the beginning of the challenge and point the laser at it thats it youre good to go youre at 7 minutes right now one more lap this might be a bad idea but I am going to try and run youre going to try and run all right braver than I thats impressive Michelle thats impressive youre doing great this is like deadlifting and running a tent on the trip at the same time having been warned of the difficulty of this test beforehand I actually spent the weeks prior strength training and preparation and if youre curious what my strength conditioning looked like for this challenge I uploaded my exact program to my fitness app challenge Fitness which you can find down in the description the next activity shes going to do we have what we call a monkey board basically its a piece of plywood with a bunch of different activities on it there you go oh my God shes going to have to demonstrate her ability to use basic tools to do things like open a lock not my first time doing locks undo a bolt remove screws God I feel like a baby trying to do this it is its amazing how much that suit will all of a sudden make simple tasks that much more difficult okay last one the wires strip the insulation off both sides twist it together around that eyeball one two three nice youre done and then the last thing were going to have her do were going to have her climb some stairs so were going to get that heart rate way up and then theres going to be a suspicious device sitting there and shes going to have 20 seconds thats it to look all the way around that device and memorize as many things she can about that green red lift for you red tape time and then shes going to come out to me at the truck and have to tell me everything she can remember about that device time woohoo 1543 was your time all right how you feeling awful lets get this jacket off get you some air all right so your last task tell me what you remember about that box okay the top has a green light thing and then underneath a red light thing and it said a lift for you with red tape and then underneath there was a red bar cool good job you passed so I passed passed yes that was so challenging so whats next so next one were going to test your fear huh within minutes of finishing the agility test I now have to put the bomb suit back on but this time in addition to a hazmat suit to simulate dealing with a chemical threat really what this test is designed to do is test her ability to work around her fear were going to put her in a hazmat suit and then were going to put the bomb suit over the top of that were going to strap an SCBA bottle to her back and put a gas mask on her face as she has to breathe through stand up my legs are shaking right now just standing it is aot way with all this stuff that were put on her were almost going to double her body weight I can do this oh my God you can do it I can do it then if thats not enough were going to putp her inside of a dark shipping container and seal her ', ' in then Im going to give her an incredibly simple childrens ', ' puzzle okay here we go childrens puzzle and it is going to take her a ridiculously long amount of time to complete a childrens puzzle oh no thats a trick theres trick sides this one goes here heres the next move okay I think I got two woo thats the ear got this cat this is so uncomfortable I feel so claustrophobic and it just feels like its getting heavier and heavier by the second its hard to see obviously shes wearing the uh gas mask plus the advisor helmet for the EOD 10 the SCBA its not natural air its hard to breathe so thats something that you have to constantly think about a to conserve air and b to calm yourself my legs are shaking and all Im doing is standing yes oh yeah right now shes been in there for approximately 10 minutes effectively she has about 25 to 30 minutes worth of the air again I cannot see what Im doing so basically I will make a decision on so what to do and then I like look away and pray that my hand does what I just thought bam yes oh my gosh one last piece I am so excited to get out of here Im ready for Tov check thats yes pass all right lets go oh my gosh been there for about 14 minutes thats an excellent time yay so now that youve passed both of the physical assessments youve got the experience of how the bomb suit feels now were going to give you some practical experience on how to diffuse and recognize devices and render them safe the blue the biggest misconception about what bomb squads do its what we see in the media all the time its go down put your face next to something and cut the red wire were almost never going to go down and actually put our physical hands on device and clip whatever you want now who can tell me what he did wrong he made up a song about cutting wir he made up a song about cutting wires unless there is a human life that I cant move away from that suspicious device Im never going to go touch it with my hands until I know its safe to do so so thats where the cutting the wire thing comes from thats where the cutting the wire thing comes from and thats when I realized that my idea of what bombs look like and how theyre disabled is almost entirely based in fiction bombs that we encounter they dont look like lot of the stuff we see in the media right theyre not the sticks of dynamite with a timer on top and a red wire going to a Detonator they look like a box a backpack they look like everyday items IEDs or improvised explosive devices are composed of a variety of components often everyday items that work together to cause damage or injury when detonated and its the job of a bomb Tech to separate those components so that the IED can no longer go off and they do this by using a device called a pan disrupt a percussion actuated non- electric you dont need to remember that what our idea is with disruption is to hopefully make it so that these components are no longer touching so they cant function together anymore this is a 12 gauge shotgun barrel oh we actually going to shoot something out of here yes what well do is well put a blank in and then well fill the barrel with water W you had this package earlier yeah and we were aiming the laser yep you aimed the laser thats going to shoot that water into that package and as it comes out the water is going to expand its going to rip that package apart and its going to hopefully accomplish our task so were literally shooting a water projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah but the only way to determine if a suspicious package is an iev is by confirming that it has all the components necessary to detonate and to figure that out safely the first task in any bomb threat call is to take an x-ray and then thats your X-ray panel right there cool so that gets x-ray imprinted on it so this gets placed behind the package we shoot the x-rays through the package and onto the film and then you go and pick up your X-ray panel without touching without touching the package there you go so now well go into the truck and well develop these y the red lights this is our scan developer wow like this yep and itll start sucking it through so you can see it scanning in here now we have one complete image what kind of things do you immediately see that looks like a like a a battery battery thats exactly what it is does this look like anything you recogn from earlier think about the box that was up at the top of the stairs ooh like one of the lights sticking out on the outside thats an LED all right what else do you see that you recognize that looks like a rule of measuring tape close look at it a little bit differently look is it a kitchen timer its a kitchen timer y good job all right what about this guy does this look familiar to you at all no have you ever taken the cover plate off of an electrical outlet or electrical switch at home oh is that what it is on the inside mhm this is the switch thats a toggle switch on a l so this is just an example of things we could see in an x-ray in the final challenge Yep this itself is not a device we dont have the explosive materials yeah its not a bomb theres no no bomb but if an x-ray does show that the device is an IED the next step is to safely move it away from any property or civilians and the safest way to do that is through the use of robots good morning Rob porath rap County bomb squad well first of all I know we just met but I have a question go ahead do you go by Bob because it starts with a b and everyones name on the bomb squad starts right my names Robert but a lot of the guys do call me Bobby lets talk robots yes so today Im going to drive this you are going to drive this robots allow us to do some analysis on a suspicious item without ever having to send a human down there if I blow up a robot yeah theyre expensive but theyre not a human all right lets start with just some basic driving this stick right here push forward on it and see what the robot does see its starting to move yeah push to the left bring it towards us that gets it to turn all with that simple stick right there right okay cameras are located here push that one that is your gripper camera so now lets talk about maybe some arm functions press that button down there that is moving the arm and the shoulder at the same time and you can even move just the wrist and you can also go up and down W lets try to pick up that water bottle down there youre on the right track oh oh feel like you have a good grip I think so beautiful yay now I can bring a water bottle to Garrett are you thirsty Garrett wait dont take it let me offer it to you so whats next we want you to run an obstacle course that we have set up but youre going to do it blind and by blind I mean your eyes are the robots actually okay okay so we have the robot positioned at start what are the rules and objectives for this obstacle course first off youre not allowed to hit any of the cones theres a bridge that youre going to go over its a wooden bridge dont fall off of that once you make it to the end of the course you need to find your suspicious item your mission is to use the robot to pick up that pipe bomb and youre going to place it into a fragmentation bag oh and theres one other rule okay do not break my robot okay 3 2 1 go oh this perspective is so difficult to use okay Im approaching the bridge dont fall off that bridge how expensive is this robot $75,000 for this one well as you guys know these videos are expensive to make so I want to say a huge thank you to Sofi who is sponsoring this video and literally helping me give away $10,000 to one of you watching Bob do you Sofi I dont well let me tell you why you should in case you didnt know Sofi is the all-in-one finance app that lets you Bank borrow and invest with Sofi checking and savings you can earn up to 4.60% % apy with direct deposit which is 10 times the national average savings rate isnt that crazy that is yeah and in just 5 weeks the money sitting in your savings account can earn more money than it would in an entire year at a big Bank savings account who are you currently banking with well bleep it oh oh oh theres the bomb okay Im going for it here we go I mean did you know that Sofi lety get paid up to two days early pay no account fees and cash in on up to $300 when you sign up with direct deposit go on tell me more oh I missed it my depth perception is off well the best news is Sofi has helped me give away $10,000 to one of you guys watching to pursue whatever your dream ambition is grabbing the Bott not and going back to enter sign up for a Sofi checking in savings account right now using my link you can click the link in the description or scan the QR code on screen to enter for your chance to win just make sure to use my link cuz its the only way to enter for a chance to win oh no oh God so I want to say a huge thank you to SOI for sponsoring this of the video and literally making this whole thing possible oh I missed so that was bad that was bad I was right at the Finish Line potentially an explosion where you dont want it to happen Okay however robots are not always available and so sometimes bomb techs will instead have to use a much more dangerous option a technique known as rigging so lets go look over here okay if we wanted wanted to take this box to where we were just standing uhhuh and if you were to just hook this line right up to this whats going to happen as soon as you start pulling its going to hit these going to hit these its going to get stuck right so we have some tools in our rigging kit that allow us to change direction this pulley right here is designed to open up and break away so we can put this ball on the Rope here so now if we run this rope through this pulley as youre pulling along as that ball goes through that pulley opens H then just clip on that Carabiner attach to the handle there and then lets go back to where we started and you can pull it there you go oh that would be really bad what do we do in this situation so we would come back down and fix it and why is this better than me just picking it up so in a situation like what just happened moving this is still potential to anger it so you picking it up you might still could set it off so it changed Direction and now its coming right back to you these techniques are crucial to do with Precision because even a slight miscalculation could be devastating and so Engineers are constantly improving the technology of bomb suits to keep the technician inside safe we have in the museum at our Sheriffs Office an old old bomb suit it looks like a combination between the Iron Man suit and a night and shining armor suit its literally got slits in the eyes but even with modern bomb suits a bomb Techs feet and hands are actually still exposed shes going to realize that we dont have gloves on when were in the suit we dont have a lot of protection on our feet so if something goes wrong even if I survive I might come out of it without hands I might come out of it without feet I might come out of it with severe injuries thats one of the realities I have to accept and thats a reality that my family had to accept also one of the activities were going to do with Michelle this week is were going to take her out to our explosive range were going to demonstrate to her the effects of explosives and although this is a controlled demonstration set up by professionals we have to treat the tests as a serious danger because when it comes to explosives Anything Can Happen coming down so were going to start small were going to show very small explosives very small energetic items first I need to show you is this the button these are the buttons the button the buttons so youre going to hold down charge until the green light lights up and then youre going to push fire I got very scared when you push that just like so what I need from you first left downrange and right okay fire in the hole loud fire in the hole fire in the hole fire in the hole all right now hold down charge until you get a green light and then press fire at the same time yep good wao oh it actually looks really cool it makes so much smoke happy 4th of ', ' July oh my God Jesus Christ fire in the hole it sounds so we s that was a good one right I didnt have my glasses on Oh no youre okay behind the trucks then were going to work our way up to some pretty big charges when I say big charges its not a large amount of material but its very powerful material were going to use the actual explosive that was used in the Oklahoma City bombing a massive Car Bomb exploded outside of a large Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City shattering that building killing 168 people including 19 children it was a huge explosion and that the explosive used was most likely a simple combination of fertilizer and fuel oil the explosive is using the Oklahoma City bombing so weve got some of that thats whats in this big bag down here wow it was well publicized in those days that it was basically fertilizer thats what this is this will look very much like the fertilizer you put in your lawn the white pills but its also an explosive when its mixed with a fuel and were going to show how an incredibly small amount to that explosive what damage it does so you can basically translate that into someone who has thousands of pounds of that doing bad things were armed oh my God this is crazy you guys ready here we go fire in the ', ' hole woo coming down whoa its all right so for reference I mean this is how this is how deep we are wow so this is about 12 lb of ammonium nitrate what they use in Oklahoma city was significantly more than that it was basically you know a rental truck full so if this is what just 12 lbs and a couple little bags will do thank goodness that uh those things dont happen every day now I know what I am up against and why its so important to to render safe quickly its unfortunate we have a need for a bomb squad but unfortunately history through the existence of mankind has proved us that humans are going to do bad things ER at the Boston Marathon twin explosion shatter a celebration turning a day of joy into a deadly nightmare but the real Horror Story here was in the garage level of the World Trade Center thats where the explosion was and they found people dead trapped in their cars so we have to have units like the bomb squad to go out and deal with these things explosive devices they can Target police officers they can Target civilians they can Target all kinds of different entities and my initial goal being a police officer is you know help protect the community help solve problems oh my God no the window blew out on our production B from that explosion so for my final challenge obviously I wont be dealing dealing with a real explosive device however when I imagine having to do that with these ramifications in real life its absolutely terrifying Michelles final challenge this week were going to present her with as close as possible a real bomb response a local fire department recently fired an employee this employee has made several threats when the chief walked out to his vehicle he found like a toolbox underneath his car there is the package right underneath the drivers side Tire okay will I have comms in the suit something we havent covered yet interestingly why youre not going to have comms someone could theoretically build a device thats sensitive to radio frequencies so if you were to have comms down there you could potentially set something off we dont want to do that my mission is to enter the parking garage locate the suspicious item and then determine if its an active IED if it is itll be my responsibility to use the tools at my disposal to render it safe all right if youre ready its time to get you suit it up Im ready lets do it when Im walking down the long walk Im alone wearing a 65- lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation which could be very dangerous or deadly if something goes wrong I could be severely injured I could lose my life and thats a reality I have to accept ', ' every step feels like molasses oh my God ', ' body is so warm my hands are freezing cold where is it okay heres the car theres a silver forward put the panel down ', ' first okay put the X-ray down I cant see okay I think this is in the right position I have 60 seconds before I have to get up though so that Im far enough away from the X-ray I hope I did that right I really hope I did okay lets see whats in the box you go pull it all the way through Im still catching my breath its tiring its just all the residual fatigue is just catching up to me weve got an image did it work it worked yay all right what do you see immediately tell me what you see I see a battery right there right and it looks like it is connect connected to a switch okay do you remember what kind of switch that is micro switch its a micro switch where are these wires going into something dark and mysterious in the back is that C4 it looks to be potentially some sort of plastic explosive right is this device safe to move I mean the switch there it makes me nervous but you diagnosed that switch correctly what has to happen for that switch it has to be unlocked yep the lid has to be open so whats the only thing that you should not do to this open it open the lid right now that that we have confirmed that the device is an active IED I now need to use rigging to safely move the device away from the truck to avoid the destruction of property and though this device is not a real explosive it is rigged with sensors and alarms that will go off to signify that it has been detonated resulting in an instant ', ' failure here here I should carry it okay yes yes yes yes okay put it in here ', ' ', ' okay do ', ' this this [Applause] no no no no no no yes yes yes yes yes hell yeah welcome back how you feeling look exhausted ', ' all right how long was that like 3 hours later its about an hour that was a long one you got the package where we wanted it hope so you got the disruptor set up yeah all right its time to push the button this button is going to feel so satisfying to push after all that I just hope it works I do too all right we need some fires in the hole from you fire in the hole fire and all fire and all fire buttons right there please work oh I really hope that worked me too holy smokes holy cow the battery theres the battery its the initiator and the explosive okay it need me 25 ft apart here we ', ' go mission accomplished yes you kicked butt for all your hard work your dedication we want to present you with this plaque honorary member honorary member of the rapal county Squad thank you so much for bringing attention to what we do I really really hope that everyone watching can see what a privilege it is to have a bomb squad in our communities especially one like this where you guys are just incredible its our pleasure thanks again thank you you know after this whole week I finally realized how to accurately describe what it feels like to be in the suit do tell feels like being boo in Monsters Z when shes dis ized as a monster except that costume weighs 65 lb lets get you out of this boo yay']
("split_texts: [{'6R1thtg8mts': ['this week on challenge accepted I am going "
 'to bomb squad Academy sh are you ready no Brian I am not ready well be '
 'detonating real explosives my God and learning how to disable those '
 'explosives to render them safe cut the red wire cut the blue wire thing '
 'thats kind of a meth so were literally shooting a projectile at a bomb for '
 'the most part yeah all while wearing a 65 lb bomb suit my legs are shaking '
 'right now just standing and this All Leads up to my final challenge where I '
 'will have to disable a bomb completely by myself before time runs out youre '
 'completely alone wearing a 65lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an '
 'unknown situation which could be very dangerous or deadly oh my God '
 "challenge accepted ', ' hi its good morning hi Brian Brian Im Brad Brian and "
 'Brad Brian and Brad on the bomb squad I love all the alliteration did you '
 'guys plan that we didnt but theres actually a lot of Brian on the bomb squad '
 'are there any Michelles theres not not yet not yet so what youre going to do '
 'right now is our physical assessment that we put all of our new recruits '
 'through in order to pass I will have to run a quarter mile while completing '
 'a series of difficult tasks tasks that will test my endurance dexterity and '
 'memory all in under 17 minutes we actually affectionately refer to the '
 'helmet youre going to be wearing as the dumb bucket cuz the dumb bucket when '
 'you put that on a lot of the stuff that youve got in your head just kind of '
 'goes out the window so you got to concentrate to remember things so were '
 'going to test your memory and if I dont pass the test I wont be allowed to '
 'continue the rest of the academy because my body cannot safely endure the '
 'mental and physical strain imposed by the 65 lb bomb suit so this is the '
 'bomb suit okay this is the first thing youre going to put on are the pants '
 'okay the point of the Physical Agility Test is to intentionally stress the '
 'candidate your brain has to be able to work while youre physically exhausted '
 'and then just put on your head there we go you like a quite contained I '
 'feels like I have a bowling ball in my head am I yelling right now a little '
 'bit but thats okay oh my God this is going to feel a little bit like its '
 'choking out for a second because thats going to be her first time putting '
 'the suit on first time feeling of that 65 lbs of weight on her shoulders all '
 'right youre in it hows it feel how does it feel I feel like a drunk Michelin '
 'man God Melle are you ready for the assessment I suppose well find out very '
 'soon Mich there is one more thing that I didnt tell you to start this whole '
 'thing youre going to be on your back on the ground yep so that exercise is '
 'used to simulate something blew up and you fell on your back and you have to '
 'get up so thats thats how youre going to start this whole thing okay '
 'probably bad time to say I have to pee Im guessing Okay right chin up there '
 'you go oh my God oh my God Michelle are you ready all right Brian I am not '
 'ready so when you are ready your time starts when you physically move and '
 "your number is one ', ' this feels so awkward so heavy this part here is "
 'just simulating the Long Walk youve left your team at the truck and you are '
 'walking towards your objective on a real call youd be all alone youd be you '
 'and your equipment so the Long Walk is possibly either the scariest or the '
 'best part of being a bomb Tech you walk alone probably at least 300 ft down '
 'to where the assist best this item is thinking about what am I going to find '
 'what do I need to do to keep myself safe what do I need to do to keep the '
 'public safe theres so much weight on my lungs like there is just breathing '
 'is difficult each obstacle is designed to test a different aspect of being a '
 'bomb Tech and is inspired by real life situations a bomb Tech would '
 'encounter out on the job and once you touch that silver pole youre done good '
 'drop the r oh Im sweating so next Michelles going to pick up some equipment '
 'I knew the bomb suit would be difficult because of the weight but what I '
 'didnt really account for is how much the suit limits your visibility you '
 'probably cant see much past the top of that chest plate can you correct she '
 'right you can see shes reaching around she doesnt even know where that pole '
 'shes reaching for is she cant see it while holding this heavy and awkward '
 'equipment I have to take another full lap around the track before starting '
 'my next task were at 5 minutes and 40 seconds right now almost there 10 more '
 'yards and after being completely exhausted from the lap I still had to '
 'remember the number I was given at the beginning of the challenge and point '
 'the laser at it thats it youre good to go youre at 7 minutes right now one '
 'more lap this might be a bad idea but I am going to try and run youre going '
 'to try and run all right braver than I thats impressive Michelle thats '
 'impressive youre doing great this is like deadlifting and running a tent on '
 'the trip at the same time having been warned of the difficulty of this test '
 'beforehand I actually spent the weeks prior strength training and '
 'preparation and if youre curious what my strength conditioning looked like '
 'for this challenge I uploaded my exact program to my fitness app challenge '
 'Fitness which you can find down in the description the next activity shes '
 'going to do we have what we call a monkey board basically its a piece of '
 'plywood with a bunch of different activities on it there you go oh my God '
 'shes going to have to demonstrate her ability to use basic tools to do '
 'things like open a lock not my first time doing locks undo a bolt remove '
 'screws God I feel like a baby trying to do this it is its amazing how much '
 'that suit will all of a sudden make simple tasks that much more difficult '
 'okay last one the wires strip the insulation off both sides twist it '
 'together around that eyeball one two three nice youre done and then the last '
 'thing were going to have her do were going to have her climb some stairs so '
 'were going to get that heart rate way up and then theres going to be a '
 'suspicious device sitting there and shes going to have 20 seconds thats it '
 'to look all the way around that device and memorize as many things she can '
 'about that green red lift for you red tape time and then shes going to come '
 'out to me at the truck and have to tell me everything she can remember about '
 'that device time woohoo 1543 was your time all right how you feeling awful '
 'lets get this jacket off get you some air all right so your last task tell '
 'me what you remember about that box okay the top has a green light thing and '
 'then underneath a red light thing and it said a lift for you with red tape '
 'and then underneath there was a red bar cool good job you passed so I passed '
 'passed yes that was so challenging so whats next so next one were going to '
 'test your fear huh within minutes of finishing the agility test I now have '
 'to put the bomb suit back on but this time in addition to a hazmat suit to '
 'simulate dealing with a chemical threat really what this test is designed to '
 'do is test her ability to work around her fear were going to put her in a '
 'hazmat suit and then were going to put the bomb suit over the top of that '
 'were going to strap an SCBA bottle to her back and put a gas mask on her '
 'face as she has to breathe through stand up my legs are shaking right now '
 'just standing it is aot way with all this stuff that were put on her were '
 'almost going to double her body weight I can do this oh my God you can do it '
 'I can do it then if thats not enough were going to putp her inside of a dark '
 "shipping container and seal her ', ' in then Im going to give her an "
 "incredibly simple childrens ', ' puzzle okay here we go childrens puzzle and "
 'it is going to take her a ridiculously long amount of time to complete a '
 'childrens puzzle oh no thats a trick theres trick sides this one goes here '
 'heres the next move okay I think I got two woo thats the ear got this cat '
 'this is so uncomfortable I feel so claustrophobic and it just feels like its '
 'getting heavier and heavier by the second its hard to see obviously shes '
 'wearing the uh gas mask plus the advisor helmet for the EOD 10 the SCBA its '
 'not natural air its hard to breathe so thats something that you have to '
 'constantly think about a to conserve air and b to calm yourself my legs are '
 'shaking and all Im doing is standing yes oh yeah right now shes been in '
 'there for approximately 10 minutes effectively she has about 25 to 30 '
 'minutes worth of the air again I cannot see what Im doing so basically I '
 'will make a decision on so what to do and then I like look away and pray '
 'that my hand does what I just thought bam yes oh my gosh one last piece I am '
 'so excited to get out of here Im ready for Tov check thats yes pass all '
 'right lets go oh my gosh been there for about 14 minutes thats an excellent '
 'time yay so now that youve passed both of the physical assessments youve got '
 'the experience of how the bomb suit feels now were going to give you some '
 'practical experience on how to diffuse and recognize devices and render them '
 'safe the blue the biggest misconception about what bomb squads do its what '
 'we see in the media all the time its go down put your face next to something '
 'and cut the red wire were almost never going to go down and actually put our '
 'physical hands on device and clip whatever you want now who can tell me what '
 'he did wrong he made up a song about cutting wir he made up a song about '
 'cutting wires unless there is a human life that I cant move away from that '
 'suspicious device Im never going to go touch it with my hands until I know '
 'its safe to do so so thats where the cutting the wire thing comes from thats '
 'where the cutting the wire thing comes from and thats when I realized that '
 'my idea of what bombs look like and how theyre disabled is almost entirely '
 'based in fiction bombs that we encounter they dont look like lot of the '
 'stuff we see in the media right theyre not the sticks of dynamite with a '
 'timer on top and a red wire going to a Detonator they look like a box a '
 'backpack they look like everyday items IEDs or improvised explosive devices '
 'are composed of a variety of components often everyday items that work '
 'together to cause damage or injury when detonated and its the job of a bomb '
 'Tech to separate those components so that the IED can no longer go off and '
 'they do this by using a device called a pan disrupt a percussion actuated '
 'non- electric you dont need to remember that what our idea is with '
 'disruption is to hopefully make it so that these components are no longer '
 'touching so they cant function together anymore this is a 12 gauge shotgun '
 'barrel oh we actually going to shoot something out of here yes what well do '
 'is well put a blank in and then well fill the barrel with water W you had '
 'this package earlier yeah and we were aiming the laser yep you aimed the '
 'laser thats going to shoot that water into that package and as it comes out '
 'the water is going to expand its going to rip that package apart and its '
 'going to hopefully accomplish our task so were literally shooting a water '
 'projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah but the only way to determine if '
 'a suspicious package is an iev is by confirming that it has all the '
 'components necessary to detonate and to figure that out safely the first '
 'task in any bomb threat call is to take an x-ray and then thats your X-ray '
 'panel right there cool so that gets x-ray imprinted on it so this gets '
 'placed behind the package we shoot the x-rays through the package and onto '
 'the film and then you go and pick up your X-ray panel without touching '
 'without touching the package there you go so now well go into the truck and '
 'well develop these y the red lights this is our scan developer wow like this '
 'yep and itll start sucking it through so you can see it scanning in here now '
 'we have one complete image what kind of things do you immediately see that '
 'looks like a like a a battery battery thats exactly what it is does this '
 'look like anything you recogn from earlier think about the box that was up '
 'at the top of the stairs ooh like one of the lights sticking out on the '
 'outside thats an LED all right what else do you see that you recognize that '
 'looks like a rule of measuring tape close look at it a little bit '
 'differently look is it a kitchen timer its a kitchen timer y good job all '
 'right what about this guy does this look familiar to you at all no have you '
 'ever taken the cover plate off of an electrical outlet or electrical switch '
 'at home oh is that what it is on the inside mhm this is the switch thats a '
 'toggle switch on a l so this is just an example of things we could see in an '
 'x-ray in the final challenge Yep this itself is not a device we dont have '
 'the explosive materials yeah its not a bomb theres no no bomb but if an '
 'x-ray does show that the device is an IED the next step is to safely move it '
 'away from any property or civilians and the safest way to do that is through '
 'the use of robots good morning Rob porath rap County bomb squad well first '
 'of all I know we just met but I have a question go ahead do you go by Bob '
 'because it starts with a b and everyones name on the bomb squad starts right '
 'my names Robert but a lot of the guys do call me Bobby lets talk robots yes '
 'so today Im going to drive this you are going to drive this robots allow us '
 'to do some analysis on a suspicious item without ever having to send a human '
 'down there if I blow up a robot yeah theyre expensive but theyre not a human '
 'all right lets start with just some basic driving this stick right here push '
 'forward on it and see what the robot does see its starting to move yeah push '
 'to the left bring it towards us that gets it to turn all with that simple '
 'stick right there right okay cameras are located here push that one that is '
 'your gripper camera so now lets talk about maybe some arm functions press '
 'that button down there that is moving the arm and the shoulder at the same '
 'time and you can even move just the wrist and you can also go up and down W '
 'lets try to pick up that water bottle down there youre on the right track oh '
 'oh feel like you have a good grip I think so beautiful yay now I can bring a '
 'water bottle to Garrett are you thirsty Garrett wait dont take it let me '
 'offer it to you so whats next we want you to run an obstacle course that we '
 'have set up but youre going to do it blind and by blind I mean your eyes are '
 'the robots actually okay okay so we have the robot positioned at start what '
 'are the rules and objectives for this obstacle course first off youre not '
 'allowed to hit any of the cones theres a bridge that youre going to go over '
 'its a wooden bridge dont fall off of that once you make it to the end of the '
 'course you need to find your suspicious item your mission is to use the '
 'robot to pick up that pipe bomb and youre going to place it into a '
 'fragmentation bag oh and theres one other rule okay do not break my robot '
 'okay 3 2 1 go oh this perspective is so difficult to use okay Im approaching '
 'the bridge dont fall off that bridge how expensive is this robot $75,000 for '
 'this one well as you guys know these videos are expensive to make so I want '
 'to say a huge thank you to Sofi who is sponsoring this video and literally '
 'helping me give away $10,000 to one of you watching Bob do you Sofi I dont '
 'well let me tell you why you should in case you didnt know Sofi is the '
 'all-in-one finance app that lets you Bank borrow and invest with Sofi '
 'checking and savings you can earn up to 4.60% % apy with direct deposit '
 'which is 10 times the national average savings rate isnt that crazy that is '
 'yeah and in just 5 weeks the money sitting in your savings account can earn '
 'more money than it would in an entire year at a big Bank savings account who '
 'are you currently banking with well bleep it oh oh oh theres the bomb okay '
 'Im going for it here we go I mean did you know that Sofi lety get paid up to '
 'two days early pay no account fees and cash in on up to $300 when you sign '
 'up with direct deposit go on tell me more oh I missed it my depth perception '
 'is off well the best news is Sofi has helped me give away $10,000 to one of '
 'you guys watching to pursue whatever your dream ambition is grabbing the '
 'Bott not and going back to enter sign up for a Sofi checking in savings '
 'account right now using my link you can click the link in the description or '
 'scan the QR code on screen to enter for your chance to win just make sure to '
 'use my link cuz its the only way to enter for a chance to win oh no oh God '
 'so I want to say a huge thank you to SOI for sponsoring this of the video '
 'and literally making this whole thing possible oh I missed so that was bad '
 'that was bad I was right at the Finish Line potentially an explosion where '
 'you dont want it to happen Okay however robots are not always available and '
 'so sometimes bomb techs will instead have to use a much more dangerous '
 'option a technique known as rigging so lets go look over here okay if we '
 'wanted wanted to take this box to where we were just standing uhhuh and if '
 'you were to just hook this line right up to this whats going to happen as '
 'soon as you start pulling its going to hit these going to hit these its '
 'going to get stuck right so we have some tools in our rigging kit that allow '
 'us to change direction this pulley right here is designed to open up and '
 'break away so we can put this ball on the Rope here so now if we run this '
 'rope through this pulley as youre pulling along as that ball goes through '
 'that pulley opens H then just clip on that Carabiner attach to the handle '
 'there and then lets go back to where we started and you can pull it there '
 'you go oh that would be really bad what do we do in this situation so we '
 'would come back down and fix it and why is this better than me just picking '
 'it up so in a situation like what just happened moving this is still '
 'potential to anger it so you picking it up you might still could set it off '
 'so it changed Direction and now its coming right back to you these '
 'techniques are crucial to do with Precision because even a slight '
 'miscalculation could be devastating and so Engineers are constantly '
 'improving the technology of bomb suits to keep the technician inside safe we '
 'have in the museum at our Sheriffs Office an old old bomb suit it looks like '
 'a combination between the Iron Man suit and a night and shining armor suit '
 'its literally got slits in the eyes but even with modern bomb suits a bomb '
 'Techs feet and hands are actually still exposed shes going to realize that '
 'we dont have gloves on when were in the suit we dont have a lot of '
 'protection on our feet so if something goes wrong even if I survive I might '
 'come out of it without hands I might come out of it without feet I might '
 'come out of it with severe injuries thats one of the realities I have to '
 'accept and thats a reality that my family had to accept also one of the '
 'activities were going to do with Michelle this week is were going to take '
 'her out to our explosive range were going to demonstrate to her the effects '
 'of explosives and although this is a controlled demonstration set up by '
 'professionals we have to treat the tests as a serious danger because when it '
 'comes to explosives Anything Can Happen coming down so were going to start '
 'small were going to show very small explosives very small energetic items '
 'first I need to show you is this the button these are the buttons the button '
 'the buttons so youre going to hold down charge until the green light lights '
 'up and then youre going to push fire I got very scared when you push that '
 'just like so what I need from you first left downrange and right okay fire '
 'in the hole loud fire in the hole fire in the hole fire in the hole all '
 'right now hold down charge until you get a green light and then press fire '
 'at the same time yep good wao oh it actually looks really cool it makes so '
 "much smoke happy 4th of ', ' July oh my God Jesus Christ fire in the hole it "
 'sounds so we s that was a good one right I didnt have my glasses on Oh no '
 'youre okay behind the trucks then were going to work our way up to some '
 'pretty big charges when I say big charges its not a large amount of material '
 'but its very powerful material were going to use the actual explosive that '
 'was used in the Oklahoma City bombing a massive Car Bomb exploded outside of '
 'a large Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City shattering that building '
 'killing 168 people including 19 children it was a huge explosion and that '
 'the explosive used was most likely a simple combination of fertilizer and '
 'fuel oil the explosive is using the Oklahoma City bombing so weve got some '
 'of that thats whats in this big bag down here wow it was well publicized in '
 'those days that it was basically fertilizer thats what this is this will '
 'look very much like the fertilizer you put in your lawn the white pills but '
 'its also an explosive when its mixed with a fuel and were going to show how '
 'an incredibly small amount to that explosive what damage it does so you can '
 'basically translate that into someone who has thousands of pounds of that '
 'doing bad things were armed oh my God this is crazy you guys ready here we '
 "go fire in the ', ' hole woo coming down whoa its all right so for reference "
 'I mean this is how this is how deep we are wow so this is about 12 lb of '
 'ammonium nitrate what they use in Oklahoma city was significantly more than '
 'that it was basically you know a rental truck full so if this is what just '
 '12 lbs and a couple little bags will do thank goodness that uh those things '
 'dont happen every day now I know what I am up against and why its so '
 'important to to render safe quickly its unfortunate we have a need for a '
 'bomb squad but unfortunately history through the existence of mankind has '
 'proved us that humans are going to do bad things ER at the Boston Marathon '
 'twin explosion shatter a celebration turning a day of joy into a deadly '
 'nightmare but the real Horror Story here was in the garage level of the '
 'World Trade Center thats where the explosion was and they found people dead '
 'trapped in their cars so we have to have units like the bomb squad to go out '
 'and deal with these things explosive devices they can Target police officers '
 'they can Target civilians they can Target all kinds of different entities '
 'and my initial goal being a police officer is you know help protect the '
 'community help solve problems oh my God no the window blew out on our '
 'production B from that explosion so for my final challenge obviously I wont '
 'be dealing dealing with a real explosive device however when I imagine '
 'having to do that with these ramifications in real life its absolutely '
 'terrifying Michelles final challenge this week were going to present her '
 'with as close as possible a real bomb response a local fire department '
 'recently fired an employee this employee has made several threats when the '
 'chief walked out to his vehicle he found like a toolbox underneath his car '
 'there is the package right underneath the drivers side Tire okay will I have '
 'comms in the suit something we havent covered yet interestingly why youre '
 'not going to have comms someone could theoretically build a device thats '
 'sensitive to radio frequencies so if you were to have comms down there you '
 'could potentially set something off we dont want to do that my mission is to '
 'enter the parking garage locate the suspicious item and then determine if '
 'its an active IED if it is itll be my responsibility to use the tools at my '
 'disposal to render it safe all right if youre ready its time to get you suit '
 'it up Im ready lets do it when Im walking down the long walk Im alone '
 'wearing a 65- lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation '
 'which could be very dangerous or deadly if something goes wrong I could be '
 'severely injured I could lose my life and thats a reality I have to accept '
 "', ' every step feels like molasses oh my God ', ' body is so warm my hands "
 'are freezing cold where is it okay heres the car theres a silver forward put '
 "the panel down ', ' first okay put the X-ray down I cant see okay I think "
 'this is in the right position I have 60 seconds before I have to get up '
 'though so that Im far enough away from the X-ray I hope I did that right I '
 'really hope I did okay lets see whats in the box you go pull it all the way '
 'through Im still catching my breath its tiring its just all the residual '
 'fatigue is just catching up to me weve got an image did it work it worked '
 'yay all right what do you see immediately tell me what you see I see a '
 'battery right there right and it looks like it is connect connected to a '
 'switch okay do you remember what kind of switch that is micro switch its a '
 'micro switch where are these wires going into something dark and mysterious '
 'in the back is that C4 it looks to be potentially some sort of plastic '
 'explosive right is this device safe to move I mean the switch there it makes '
 'me nervous but you diagnosed that switch correctly what has to happen for '
 'that switch it has to be unlocked yep the lid has to be open so whats the '
 'only thing that you should not do to this open it open the lid right now '
 'that that we have confirmed that the device is an active IED I now need to '
 'use rigging to safely move the device away from the truck to avoid the '
 'destruction of property and though this device is not a real explosive it is '
 'rigged with sensors and alarms that will go off to signify that it has been '
 "detonated resulting in an instant ', ' failure here here I should carry it "
 "okay yes yes yes yes okay put it in here ', ' ', ' okay do ', ' this this "
 '[Applause] no no no no no no yes yes yes yes yes hell yeah welcome back how '
 "you feeling look exhausted ', ' all right how long was that like 3 hours "
 'later its about an hour that was a long one you got the package where we '
 'wanted it hope so you got the disruptor set up yeah all right its time to '
 'push the button this button is going to feel so satisfying to push after all '
 'that I just hope it works I do too all right we need some fires in the hole '
 'from you fire in the hole fire and all fire and all fire buttons right there '
 'please work oh I really hope that worked me too holy smokes holy cow the '
 'battery theres the battery its the initiator and the explosive okay it need '
 "me 25 ft apart here we ', ' go mission accomplished yes you kicked butt for "
 'all your hard work your dedication we want to present you with this plaque '
 'honorary member honorary member of the rapal county Squad thank you so much '
 'for bringing attention to what we do I really really hope that everyone '
 'watching can see what a privilege it is to have a bomb squad in our '
 'communities especially one like this where you guys are just incredible its '
 'our pleasure thanks again thank you you know after this whole week I finally '
 'realized how to accurately describe what it feels like to be in the suit do '
 'tell feels like being boo in Monsters Z when shes dis ized as a monster '

 'both of the physical assessments\', "you\'ve got the experience of how the", '
 '"bomb suit feels now we\'re going to give", \'you some practical experience '
 "on how to', 'diffuse and recognize devices and render', 'them safe the', "
 '\'blue the biggest misconception about\', "what bomb squads do it\'s what we '
 'see in", "the media all the time it\'s go down put", \'your face next to '
 'something and cut the\', "red wire we\'re almost never going to go", \'down '
 "and actually put our physical hands', 'on device and clip whatever you', "
 "'want now who can tell me what he did', 'wrong he made up a song about "

 'human life that\', "I can\'t move away from that suspicious", "device I\'m '
 'never going to go touch it", "with my hands until I know it\'s safe to", "do '
 'so so that\'s where the cutting the", "wire thing comes from that\'s where '
 'the", \'cutting the wire thing comes from and\', "that\'s when I realized '
 'that my idea of", "what bombs look like and how they\'re", \'disabled is '
 "almost entirely based in', 'fiction bombs that we encounter they', "
 '"don\'t look like lot of the stuff we see", "in the media right they\'re not '
 'the", \'sticks of dynamite with a timer on top\', \'and a red wire going to '
 "a Detonator they', 'look like a box a backpack they look', 'like everyday "
 "items IEDs or improvised', 'explosive devices are composed of a', 'variety "
 "of components often everyday', 'items that work together to cause damage', "
 '"or injury when detonated and it\'s the", \'job of a bomb Tech to separate '
 "those', 'components so that the IED can no longer', 'go off and they do this "
 "by using a', 'device called a pan disrupt', 'a percussion actuated non- "
 'electric you\', "don\'t need to remember that what our", \'idea is with '
 "disruption is to hopefully', 'make it so that these components are no', "
 '"longer touching so they can\'t function", \'together anymore this is a 12 '
 "gauge', 'shotgun barrel oh we actually going to', 'shoot something out of "
 'here yes what\', "we\'ll do is we\'ll put a blank in and", "then we\'ll fill '
 'the barrel with water W", \'you had this package earlier yeah and we\', '
 '\'were aiming the laser yep you aimed the\', "laser that\'s going to shoot '
 'that water", \'into that package and as it comes out\', "the water is going '
 'to expand it\'s going", "to rip that package apart and it\'s going", \'to '
 'hopefully accomplish our task so\', "we\'re literally shooting a water", '
 "'projectile at a bomb for the most part', 'yeah but the only way to "
 "determine if a', 'suspicious package is an iev is by', 'confirming that it "
 "has all the', 'components necessary to detonate and to', 'figure that out "
 'safely the first task in\', \'any bomb threat call is to take an\', "x-ray '
 'and then that\'s your X-ray panel", \'right there cool so that gets x-ray\', '
 "'imprinted on it so this gets placed', 'behind the package we shoot the "
 "x-rays', 'through the package and onto the', 'film and then you go and pick "
 "up your', 'X-ray panel without touching without', 'touching the package "
 'there you go so now\', "we\'ll go into the truck and we\'ll", \'develop '
 'these y the red lights this is\', \'our scan developer\', "wow like this yep '
 'and it\'ll start", \'sucking it through so you can see it\', \'scanning in '
 "here now we have one', 'complete image what kind of things do', 'you "
 'immediately see that looks like a\', "like a a battery battery that\'s '
 'exactly", \'what it is does this look like anything\', \'you recogn from '
 "earlier think about the', 'box that was up at the top of the stairs', 'ooh "
 'like one of the lights sticking out\', "on the outside that\'s an LED all '
 'right", \'what else do you see that you recognize\', \'that looks like a '
 "rule of measuring tape', 'close look at it a little bit', 'differently look "
 'is it a kitchen timer\', "it\'s a kitchen timer y good job all", \'right '
 "what about this guy does this look', 'familiar to you at all no have you "
 "ever', 'taken the cover plate off of an', 'electrical outlet or electrical "
 'switch\', \'at home oh is that what it is on the\', "inside mhm this is the '
 'switch that\'s a", \'toggle switch on a l so this is just an\', \'example of '
 "things we could see in an', 'x-ray in the final challenge Yep this', "
 '"itself is not a device we don\'t have the", "explosive materials yeah it\'s '
 'not a bomb", "there\'s no no bomb but if an x-ray does", \'show that the '
 "device is an IED the next', 'step is to safely move it away from any', "
 "'property or civilians and the safest way', 'to do that is through the use "
 "of robots', 'good morning Rob porath rap County bomb', 'squad well first of "
 "all I know we just', 'met but I have a question go ahead do', 'you go by Bob "
 'because it starts with a b\', "and everyone\'s name on the bomb squad", '
 '"starts right my name\'s Robert but a lot", \'of the guys do call me\', '
 '"Bobby let\'s talk robots yes so today I\'m", \'going to drive this you are '
 "going to', 'drive this robots allow us to do some', 'analysis on a "

 "that is moving the arm', 'and the shoulder at the same time and', 'you can "

 'can bring a water\', \'bottle to Garrett are you thirsty\', "Garrett wait '
 'don\'t take it let me offer", \'it to\', "you so what\'s next we want you to '

 "okay', 'okay so we have the robot positioned at', 'start what are the rules "

 "{'6R1thtg8mts': ['this week on challenge accepted I am going to bomb squad "
 'Academy sh are you ready no Brian I am not ready well be detonating real '
 'explosives my God and learning how to disable those explosives to render '
 'them safe cut the red wire cut the blue wire thing thats kind of a meth so '
 'were literally shooting a projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah all '
 'while wearing a 65 lb bomb suit my legs are shaking right now just standing '
 'and this All Leads up to my final challenge where I will have to disable a '
 'bomb completely by myself before time runs out youre completely alone '
 'wearing a 65lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation '
 "which could be very dangerous or deadly oh my God challenge accepted ', ' hi "
 'its good morning hi Brian Brian Im Brad Brian and Brad Brian and Brad on the '
 'bomb squad I love all the alliteration did you guys plan that we didnt but '
 'theres actually a lot of Brian on the bomb squad are there any Michelles '
 'theres not not yet not yet so what youre going to do right now is our '
 'physical assessment that we put all of our new recruits through in order to '
 'pass I will have to run a quarter mile while completing a series of '
 'difficult tasks tasks that will test my endurance dexterity and memory all '
 'in under 17 minutes we actually affectionately refer to the helmet youre '
 'going to be wearing as the dumb bucket cuz the dumb bucket when you put that '
 'on a lot of the stuff that youve got in your head just kind of goes out the '
 'window so you got to concentrate to remember things so were going to test '
 'your memory and if I dont pass the test I wont be allowed to continue the '
 'rest of the academy because my body cannot safely endure the mental and '
 'physical strain imposed by the 65 lb bomb suit so this is the bomb suit okay '
 'this is the first thing youre going to put on are the pants okay the point '
 'of the Physical Agility Test is to intentionally stress the candidate your '
 'brain has to be able to work while youre physically exhausted and then just '
 'put on your head there we go you like a quite contained I feels like I have '
 'a bowling ball in my head am I yelling right now a little bit but thats okay '
 'oh my God this is going to feel a little bit like its choking out for a '
 'second because thats going to be her first time putting the suit on first '
 'time feeling of that 65 lbs of weight on her shoulders all right youre in it '
 'hows it feel how does it feel I feel like a drunk Michelin man God Melle are '
 'you ready for the assessment I suppose well find out very soon Mich there is '
 'one more thing that I didnt tell you to start this whole thing youre going '
 'to be on your back on the ground yep so that exercise is used to simulate '
 'something blew up and you fell on your back and you have to get up so thats '
 'thats how youre going to start this whole thing okay probably bad time to '
 'say I have to pee Im guessing Okay right chin up there you go oh my God oh '
 'my God Michelle are you ready all right Brian I am not ready so when you are '
 "ready your time starts when you physically move and your number is one ', ' "
 'this feels so awkward so heavy this part here is just simulating the Long '
 'Walk youve left your team at the truck and you are walking towards your '
 'objective on a real call youd be all alone youd be you and your equipment so '
 'the Long Walk is possibly either the scariest or the best part of being a '
 'bomb Tech you walk alone probably at least 300 ft down to where the assist '
 'best this item is thinking about what am I going to find what do I need to '
 'do to keep myself safe what do I need to do to keep the public safe theres '
 'so much weight on my lungs like there is just breathing is difficult each '
 'obstacle is designed to test a different aspect of being a bomb Tech and is '
 'inspired by real life situations a bomb Tech would encounter out on the job '
 'and once you touch that silver pole youre done good drop the r oh Im '
 'sweating so next Michelles going to pick up some equipment I knew the bomb '
 'suit would be difficult because of the weight but what I didnt really '
 'account for is how much the suit limits your visibility you probably cant '
 'see much past the top of that chest plate can you correct she right you can '
 'see shes reaching around she doesnt even know where that pole shes reaching '
 'for is she cant see it while holding this heavy and awkward equipment I have '
 'to take another full lap around the track before starting my next task were '
 'at 5 minutes and 40 seconds right now almost there 10 more yards and after '
 'being completely exhausted from the lap I still had to remember the number I '
 'was given at the beginning of the challenge and point the laser at it thats '
 'it youre good to go youre at 7 minutes right now one more lap this might be '
 'a bad idea but I am going to try and run youre going to try and run all '
 'right braver than I thats impressive Michelle thats impressive youre doing '
 'great this is like deadlifting and running a tent on the trip at the same '
 'time having been warned of the difficulty of this test beforehand I actually '
 'spent the weeks prior strength training and preparation and if youre curious '
 'what my strength conditioning looked like for this challenge I uploaded my '
 'exact program to my fitness app challenge Fitness which you can find down in '
 'the description the next activity shes going to do we have what we call a '
 'monkey board basically its a piece of plywood with a bunch of different '
 'activities on it there you go oh my God shes going to have to demonstrate '
 'her ability to use basic tools to do things like open a lock not my first '
 'time doing locks undo a bolt remove screws God I feel like a baby trying to '
 'do this it is its amazing how much that suit will all of a sudden make '
 'simple tasks that much more difficult okay last one the wires strip the '
 'insulation off both sides twist it together around that eyeball one two '
 'three nice youre done and then the last thing were going to have her do were '
 'going to have her climb some stairs so were going to get that heart rate way '
 'up and then theres going to be a suspicious device sitting there and shes '
 'going to have 20 seconds thats it to look all the way around that device and '
 'memorize as many things she can about that green red lift for you red tape '
 'time and then shes going to come out to me at the truck and have to tell me '
 'everything she can remember about that device time woohoo 1543 was your time '
 'all right how you feeling awful lets get this jacket off get you some air '
 'all right so your last task tell me what you remember about that box okay '
 'the top has a green light thing and then underneath a red light thing and it '
 'said a lift for you with red tape and then underneath there was a red bar '
 'cool good job you passed so I passed passed yes that was so challenging so '
 'whats next so next one were going to test your fear huh within minutes of '
 'finishing the agility test I now have to put the bomb suit back on but this '
 'time in addition to a hazmat suit to simulate dealing with a chemical threat '
 'really what this test is designed to do is test her ability to work around '
 'her fear were going to put her in a hazmat suit and then were going to put '
 'the bomb suit over the top of that were going to strap an SCBA bottle to her '
 'back and put a gas mask on her face as she has to breathe through stand up '
 'my legs are shaking right now just standing it is aot way with all this '
 'stuff that were put on her were almost going to double her body weight I can '
 'do this oh my God you can do it I can do it then if thats not enough were '
 "going to putp her inside of a dark shipping container and seal her ', ' in "
 "then Im going to give her an incredibly simple childrens ', ' puzzle okay "
 'here we go childrens puzzle and it is going to take her a ridiculously long '
 'amount of time to complete a childrens puzzle oh no thats a trick theres '
 'trick sides this one goes here heres the next move okay I think I got two '
 'woo thats the ear got this cat this is so uncomfortable I feel so '
 'claustrophobic and it just feels like its getting heavier and heavier by the '
 'second its hard to see obviously shes wearing the uh gas mask plus the '
 'advisor helmet for the EOD 10 the SCBA its not natural air its hard to '
 'breathe so thats something that you have to constantly think about a to '
 'conserve air and b to calm yourself my legs are shaking and all Im doing is '
 'standing yes oh yeah right now shes been in there for approximately 10 '
 'minutes effectively she has about 25 to 30 minutes worth of the air again I '
 'cannot see what Im doing so basically I will make a decision on so what to '
 'do and then I like look away and pray that my hand does what I just thought '
 'bam yes oh my gosh one last piece I am so excited to get out of here Im '
 'ready for Tov check thats yes pass all right lets go oh my gosh been there '
 'for about 14 minutes thats an excellent time yay so now that youve passed '
 'both of the physical assessments youve got the experience of how the bomb '
 'suit feels now were going to give you some practical experience on how to '
 'diffuse and recognize devices and render them safe the blue the biggest '
 'misconception about what bomb squads do its what we see in the media all the '
 'time its go down put your face next to something and cut the red wire were '
 'almost never going to go down and actually put our physical hands on device '
 'and clip whatever you want now who can tell me what he did wrong he made up '
 'a song about cutting wir he made up a song about cutting wires unless there '
 'is a human life that I cant move away from that suspicious device Im never '
 'going to go touch it with my hands until I know its safe to do so so thats '
 'where the cutting the wire thing comes from thats where the cutting the wire '
 'thing comes from and thats when I realized that my idea of what bombs look '
 'like and how theyre disabled is almost entirely based in fiction bombs that '
 'we encounter they dont look like lot of the stuff we see in the media right '
 'theyre not the sticks of dynamite with a timer on top and a red wire going '
 'to a Detonator they look like a box a backpack they look like everyday items '
 'IEDs or improvised explosive devices are composed of a variety of components '
 'often everyday items that work together to cause damage or injury when '
 'detonated and its the job of a bomb Tech to separate those components so '
 'that the IED can no longer go off and they do this by using a device called '
 'a pan disrupt a percussion actuated non- electric you dont need to remember '
 'that what our idea is with disruption is to hopefully make it so that these '
 'components are no longer touching so they cant function together anymore '
 'this is a 12 gauge shotgun barrel oh we actually going to shoot something '
 'out of here yes what well do is well put a blank in and then well fill the '
 'barrel with water W you had this package earlier yeah and we were aiming the '
 'laser yep you aimed the laser thats going to shoot that water into that '
 'package and as it comes out the water is going to expand its going to rip '
 'that package apart and its going to hopefully accomplish our task so were '
 'literally shooting a water projectile at a bomb for the most part yeah but '
 'the only way to determine if a suspicious package is an iev is by confirming '
 'that it has all the components necessary to detonate and to figure that out '
 'safely the first task in any bomb threat call is to take an x-ray and then '
 'thats your X-ray panel right there cool so that gets x-ray imprinted on it '
 'so this gets placed behind the package we shoot the x-rays through the '
 'package and onto the film and then you go and pick up your X-ray panel '
 'without touching without touching the package there you go so now well go '
 'into the truck and well develop these y the red lights this is our scan '
 'developer wow like this yep and itll start sucking it through so you can see '
 'it scanning in here now we have one complete image what kind of things do '
 'you immediately see that looks like a like a a battery battery thats exactly '
 'what it is does this look like anything you recogn from earlier think about '
 'the box that was up at the top of the stairs ooh like one of the lights '
 'sticking out on the outside thats an LED all right what else do you see that '
 'you recognize that looks like a rule of measuring tape close look at it a '
 'little bit differently look is it a kitchen timer its a kitchen timer y good '
 'job all right what about this guy does this look familiar to you at all no '
 'have you ever taken the cover plate off of an electrical outlet or '
 'electrical switch at home oh is that what it is on the inside mhm this is '
 'the switch thats a toggle switch on a l so this is just an example of things '
 'we could see in an x-ray in the final challenge Yep this itself is not a '
 'device we dont have the explosive materials yeah its not a bomb theres no no '
 'bomb but if an x-ray does show that the device is an IED the next step is to '
 'safely move it away from any property or civilians and the safest way to do '
 'that is through the use of robots good morning Rob porath rap County bomb '
 'squad well first of all I know we just met but I have a question go ahead do '
 'you go by Bob because it starts with a b and everyones name on the bomb '
 'squad starts right my names Robert but a lot of the guys do call me Bobby '
 'lets talk robots yes so today Im going to drive this you are going to drive '
 'this robots allow us to do some analysis on a suspicious item without ever '
 'having to send a human down there if I blow up a robot yeah theyre expensive '
 'but theyre not a human all right lets start with just some basic driving '
 'this stick right here push forward on it and see what the robot does see its '
 'starting to move yeah push to the left bring it towards us that gets it to '
 'turn all with that simple stick right there right okay cameras are located '
 'here push that one that is your gripper camera so now lets talk about maybe '
 'some arm functions press that button down there that is moving the arm and '
 'the shoulder at the same time and you can even move just the wrist and you '
 'can also go up and down W lets try to pick up that water bottle down there '
 'youre on the right track oh oh feel like you have a good grip I think so '
 'beautiful yay now I can bring a water bottle to Garrett are you thirsty '
 'Garrett wait dont take it let me offer it to you so whats next we want you '
 'to run an obstacle course that we have set up but youre going to do it blind '
 'and by blind I mean your eyes are the robots actually okay okay so we have '
 'the robot positioned at start what are the rules and objectives for this '
 'obstacle course first off youre not allowed to hit any of the cones theres a '
 'bridge that youre going to go over its a wooden bridge dont fall off of that '
 'once you make it to the end of the course you need to find your suspicious '
 'item your mission is to use the robot to pick up that pipe bomb and youre '
 'going to place it into a fragmentation bag oh and theres one other rule okay '
 'do not break my robot okay 3 2 1 go oh this perspective is so difficult to '
 'use okay Im approaching the bridge dont fall off that bridge how expensive '
 'is this robot $75,000 for this one well as you guys know these videos are '
 'expensive to make so I want to say a huge thank you to Sofi who is '
 'sponsoring this video and literally helping me give away $10,000 to one of '
 'you watching Bob do you Sofi I dont well let me tell you why you should in '

 'Bank savings account who are you currently banking with well bleep it oh oh '
 'oh theres the bomb okay Im going for it here we go I mean did you know that '
 'Sofi lety get paid up to two days early pay no account fees and cash in on '
 'up to $300 when you sign up with direct deposit go on tell me more oh I '
 'missed it my depth perception is off well the best news is Sofi has helped '
 'me give away $10,000 to one of you guys watching to pursue whatever your '
 'dream ambition is grabbing the Bott not and going back to enter sign up for '
 'a Sofi checking in savings account right now using my link you can click the '
 'link in the description or scan the QR code on screen to enter for your '
 'chance to win just make sure to use my link cuz its the only way to enter '
 'for a chance to win oh no oh God so I want to say a huge thank you to SOI '
 'for sponsoring this of the video and literally making this whole thing '
 'possible oh I missed so that was bad that was bad I was right at the Finish '
 'Line potentially an explosion where you dont want it to happen Okay however '
 'robots are not always available and so sometimes bomb techs will instead '
 'have to use a much more dangerous option a technique known as rigging so '
 'lets go look over here okay if we wanted wanted to take this box to where we '
 'were just standing uhhuh and if you were to just hook this line right up to '
 'this whats going to happen as soon as you start pulling its going to hit '
 'these going to hit these its going to get stuck right so we have some tools '
 'in our rigging kit that allow us to change direction this pulley right here '
 'is designed to open up and break away so we can put this ball on the Rope '
 'here so now if we run this rope through this pulley as youre pulling along '
 'as that ball goes through that pulley opens H then just clip on that '
 'Carabiner attach to the handle there and then lets go back to where we '
 'started and you can pull it there you go oh that would be really bad what do '
 'we do in this situation so we would come back down and fix it and why is '
 'this better than me just picking it up so in a situation like what just '
 'happened moving this is still potential to anger it so you picking it up you '
 'might still could set it off so it changed Direction and now its coming '
 'right back to you these techniques are crucial to do with Precision because '
 'even a slight miscalculation could be devastating and so Engineers are '
 'constantly improving the technology of bomb suits to keep the technician '
 'inside safe we have in the museum at our Sheriffs Office an old old bomb '
 'suit it looks like a combination between the Iron Man suit and a night and '
 'shining armor suit its literally got slits in the eyes but even with modern '
 'bomb suits a bomb Techs feet and hands are actually still exposed shes going '
 'to realize that we dont have gloves on when were in the suit we dont have a '
 'lot of protection on our feet so if something goes wrong even if I survive I '
 'might come out of it without hands I might come out of it without feet I '
 'might come out of it with severe injuries thats one of the realities I have '
 'to accept and thats a reality that my family had to accept also one of the '
 'activities were going to do with Michelle this week is were going to take '
 'her out to our explosive range were going to demonstrate to her the effects '
 'of explosives and although this is a controlled demonstration set up by '
 'professionals we have to treat the tests as a serious danger because when it '
 'comes to explosives Anything Can Happen coming down so were going to start '
 'small were going to show very small explosives very small energetic items '
 'first I need to show you is this the button these are the buttons the button '
 'the buttons so youre going to hold down charge until the green light lights '
 'up and then youre going to push fire I got very scared when you push that '
 'just like so what I need from you first left downrange and right okay fire '
 'in the hole loud fire in the hole fire in the hole fire in the hole all '
 'right now hold down charge until you get a green light and then press fire '
 'at the same time yep good wao oh it actually looks really cool it makes so '
 "much smoke happy 4th of ', ' July oh my God Jesus Christ fire in the hole it "
 'sounds so we s that was a good one right I didnt have my glasses on Oh no '
 'youre okay behind the trucks then were going to work our way up to some '
 'pretty big charges when I say big charges its not a large amount of material '
 'but its very powerful material were going to use the actual explosive that '
 'was used in the Oklahoma City bombing a massive Car Bomb exploded outside of '
 'a large Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City shattering that building '
 'killing 168 people including 19 children it was a huge explosion and that '
 'the explosive used was most likely a simple combination of fertilizer and '
 'fuel oil the explosive is using the Oklahoma City bombing so weve got some '
 'of that thats whats in this big bag down here wow it was well publicized in '
 'those days that it was basically fertilizer thats what this is this will '
 'look very much like the fertilizer you put in your lawn the white pills but '
 'its also an explosive when its mixed with a fuel and were going to show how '
 'an incredibly small amount to that explosive what damage it does so you can '
 'basically translate that into someone who has thousands of pounds of that '
 'doing bad things were armed oh my God this is crazy you guys ready here we '
 "go fire in the ', ' hole woo coming down whoa its all right so for reference "
 'I mean this is how this is how deep we are wow so this is about 12 lb of '
 'ammonium nitrate what they use in Oklahoma city was significantly more than '
 'that it was basically you know a rental truck full so if this is what just '
 '12 lbs and a couple little bags will do thank goodness that uh those things '
 'dont happen every day now I know what I am up against and why its so '
 'important to to render safe quickly its unfortunate we have a need for a '
 'bomb squad but unfortunately history through the existence of mankind has '
 'proved us that humans are going to do bad things ER at the Boston Marathon '
 'twin explosion shatter a celebration turning a day of joy into a deadly '
 'nightmare but the real Horror Story here was in the garage level of the '
 'World Trade Center thats where the explosion was and they found people dead '
 'trapped in their cars so we have to have units like the bomb squad to go out '
 'and deal with these things explosive devices they can Target police officers '
 'they can Target civilians they can Target all kinds of different entities '
 'and my initial goal being a police officer is you know help protect the '
 'community help solve problems oh my God no the window blew out on our '
 'production B from that explosion so for my final challenge obviously I wont '
 'be dealing dealing with a real explosive device however when I imagine '
 'having to do that with these ramifications in real life its absolutely '
 'terrifying Michelles final challenge this week were going to present her '
 'with as close as possible a real bomb response a local fire department '
 'recently fired an employee this employee has made several threats when the '
 'chief walked out to his vehicle he found like a toolbox underneath his car '
 'there is the package right underneath the drivers side Tire okay will I have '
 'comms in the suit something we havent covered yet interestingly why youre '
 'not going to have comms someone could theoretically build a device thats '
 'sensitive to radio frequencies so if you were to have comms down there you '
 'could potentially set something off we dont want to do that my mission is to '
 'enter the parking garage locate the suspicious item and then determine if '
 'its an active IED if it is itll be my responsibility to use the tools at my '
 'disposal to render it safe all right if youre ready its time to get you suit '
 'it up Im ready lets do it when Im walking down the long walk Im alone '
 'wearing a 65- lb suit with limited Mobility heading for an unknown situation '
 'which could be very dangerous or deadly if something goes wrong I could be '
 'severely injured I could lose my life and thats a reality I have to accept '
 "', ' every step feels like molasses oh my God ', ' body is so warm my hands "
 'are freezing cold where is it okay heres the car theres a silver forward put '
 "the panel down ', ' first okay put the X-ray down I cant see okay I think "
 'this is in the right position I have 60 seconds before I have to get up '
 'though so that Im far enough away from the X-ray I hope I did that right I '
 'really hope I did okay lets see whats in the box you go pull it all the way '
 'through Im still catching my breath its tiring its just all the residual '
 'fatigue is just catching up to me weve got an image did it work it worked '
 'yay all right what do you see immediately tell me what you see I see a '
 'battery right there right and it looks like it is connect connected to a '
 'switch okay do you remember what kind of switch that is micro switch its a '
 'micro switch where are these wires going into something dark and mysterious '
 'in the back is that C4 it looks to be potentially some sort of plastic '
 'explosive right is this device safe to move I mean the switch there it makes '
 'me nervous but you diagnosed that switch correctly what has to happen for '
 'that switch it has to be unlocked yep the lid has to be open so whats the '
 'only thing that you should not do to this open it open the lid right now '
 'that that we have confirmed that the device is an active IED I now need to '
 'use rigging to safely move the device away from the truck to avoid the '
 'destruction of property and though this device is not a real explosive it is '
 'rigged with sensors and alarms that will go off to signify that it has been '
 "detonated resulting in an instant ', ' failure here here I should carry it "
 "okay yes yes yes yes okay put it in here ', ' ', ' okay do ', ' this this "
 '[Applause] no no no no no no yes yes yes yes yes hell yeah welcome back how '
 "you feeling look exhausted ', ' all right how long was that like 3 hours "
 'later its about an hour that was a long one you got the package where we '
 'wanted it hope so you got the disruptor set up yeah all right its time to '
 'push the button this button is going to feel so satisfying to push after all '
 'that I just hope it works I do too all right we need some fires in the hole '
 'from you fire in the hole fire and all fire and all fire buttons right there '
 'please work oh I really hope that worked me too holy smokes holy cow the '
 'battery theres the battery its the initiator and the explosive okay it need '
 "me 25 ft apart here we ', ' go mission accomplished yes you kicked butt for "
 'all your hard work your dedication we want to present you with this plaque '
 'honorary member honorary member of the rapal county Squad thank you so much '
 'for bringing attention to what we do I really really hope that everyone '
 'watching can see what a privilege it is to have a bomb squad in our '
 'communities especially one like this where you guys are just incredible its '
 'our pleasure thanks again thank you you know after this whole week I finally '
 'realized how to accurately describe what it feels like to be in the suit do '
 'tell feels like being boo in Monsters Z when shes dis ized as a monster '
 "except that costume weighs 65 lb lets get you out of this boo yay']}")
